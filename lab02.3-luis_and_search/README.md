# lab02.3-luis_and_search - Developing Intelligent Applications with LUIS and Azure Search


## Objective
The objective of this workshop is to learn how to weave intelligent features into your applications, specifically related to:

- [] Microsoft Bot Framework
- [] Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS)
- [] Azure Search

The hands-on lab guides you through creating an intelligent bot from end-to-end. While there is a focus on the LUIS and Azure Search, you will also leverage the following technologies:

- [ ] Computer Vision API
- [ ] Face API
- [ ] Emotion API
- [ ] Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM)
- [ ] Windows 10 App Development (UWP)
- [ ] CosmosDB
- [ ] Azure Storage
