# lab03.1-tdsp_and_amls - The Team Data Science Process using Azure Machine Learning

This hands-on lab guides you through using the [Team Data Science Process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview) using [Azure Machine Learning Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/overview-what-is-azure-ml) with the Azure Machine Learning Workbench.

You'll focus on the objectives above, not Data Science, Machine Learning or a difficult scenario. You'll use the Iris flower data set, a canonical example for predictions and Data Mining.
This data set is traditionally used for classification and prediction â€“ to see which features of an iris can identify the flower as a certain type of iris. The values for length and width can be used to classify an iris into one of three iris types: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, or Iris virginica. Visually exploring this data also lets you see the grouping (clustering) of the records into these three different types of irises.

## Introduction and setup 

You'll use Microsoft Azure and a Data Science Vitual Machine (DSVM) to run this lab, since it has everything you need to get started. (TODO)

You'll also use Visual Studio Team Services (TODO). And we'll also mention a few [Developer Operations (DevOps)](https://docsmsftpdfs.blob.core.windows.net/guides/azure/azure-ops-guide.pdf) integration steps as we go.
