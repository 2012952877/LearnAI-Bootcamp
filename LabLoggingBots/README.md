# Introduction 
This is a placeholder for the 4 day bootcamp to get the ball rolling.

The goal of this bootcamp is to kick-start advanced training for individuals who would like to be able to do the following:

1)	Create a web application leveraging Generally Available Cognitive Services REST APIs to meet customer business needs.
2)	Leverage Azure Search to provide a positive search experience inside of a web application.
3)	Build, test, and monitor intelligent bots using Azure Bot Services and LUIS.
4)	Leverage and evangelize the most effective process for building, delivering, and managing AI-infused applications on Azure (i.e. the Team Data Science Process).
5)	Leverage Azure Machine Learning Services to run experiments and manage and deploy models.
6)	Leverage appropriate IaaS (e.g. the Data Science/Deep Learning Virtual Machine) and managed Services (e.g. Spark on HDInsight, Batch AI, AML Services) to efficiently execute deep-learning workflows, regardless of backend computational framework (e.g. TensorFlow, Cognitive Toolkit, etc).

We can't accomplish all of these in a single 4 day bootcamp, so we've curated and developed labs that focus on key workloads and activities in these domains. The first two days focus on kick-starting the first three learning objectives, and the second two days focus on kick-starting the last three. The pre-requisites for the first two days are different than the pre-requisites for the second two, so they are listed out separately:

- [Details for first two days](day_one_and_two)
- [Details for the second two days](day_three_and_four)

NOTES:
- we can re-organize to individual days
- numbering labs is just for internal tracking
- descriptions for agenda and goal for each day are just placeholders.
- pre-work definition in pre-reqs
    - deploy a DSVM (?)
    - Spark on HDI deployed using these instructions: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-apache-spark-jupyter-spark-sql
