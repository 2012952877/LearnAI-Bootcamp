# Welcome

Welcome to the first two days of the Cloud AI Bootcamp. In these two days, we will focus on hands-on activities that develop proficiency in AI-oriented services such as Azure Bot Services, Azure Search, and Cognitive Services. These labs assume a introductory to intermediate knowledge of these services, and if this is not the case, then you should spend the time working through the pre-requisites.

# Pre-requisites

## Resources
- An Azure Subscription
- TODO: Additional?

 ## Azure Bot Services

- We expect that you have already built your first bot, and have the relevant libraries to build and deploy these. A good introductory course is available on LinkedIn learning:
  - [Part 1](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/creating-bots-with-the-microsoft-bot-framework-part-1)
  - [Part 2](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/creating-bots-with-the-microsoft-bot-framework-part-2)
  - TODO: Choose language (node.js is what's used to implement the bot example)

 ## Azure Search

- 

 ## Cognitive Services

- 

 ## Languages

- Node.js is leveraged for the bot implementation
- Familiarity with REST APIs

# Agenda and Goals

Most challenges observed by customers in these realms are in stitching multiple services together. As such, where possible, we have tried to place key concepts in the context of a broader example. 

We have tried to leverage a [gallery example](https://github.com/Azure/cortana-intelligence-interactive-voice-response-bot) for discussing interactions between Azure Bot Services and various other services, and we have also focused on an additional  kiosk to show how various services can come together in an integrated whole in the [Intelligent Kiosk](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Samples-IntelligentKiosk)
