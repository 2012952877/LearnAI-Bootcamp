# Welcome

Welcome to the second two days of the Cloud AI Bootcamp. In these two days, we will focus on hands-on activities that develop proficiency in AI-oriented workflows leveraging Azure Machine Learning Services, Team Data Science Process, . These labs assume a introductory to intermediate knowledge of these services, and if this is not the case, then you should spend the time working through the pre-requisites.

# Pre-requisites

## Resources

- An Azure Subscription
- A VSTS subscription to leverage collaborative features of AMLS

 ## Azure Machine Learning Services

- Python Knowledge
- Data Science Workflow familiarity

 ## 

 ## Languages

- Python
- Familiarity with Git.

# Agenda and Goals

Most challenges observed by customers in these realms are in stitching multiple services together. As such, where possible, we have tried to place key concepts in the context of a broader example. 

We have tried to leverage a [gallery example](https://github.com/Azure/cortana-intelligence-interactive-voice-response-bot) for discussing interactions between Azure Bot Services and various other services, and we have also focused on an additional  kiosk to show how various services can come together in an integrated whole in the [Intelligent Kiosk](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Samples-IntelligentKiosk)
