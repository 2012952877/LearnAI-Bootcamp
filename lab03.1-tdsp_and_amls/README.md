# lab03.1-tdsp_and_amls - The Team Data Science Process using Azure Machine Learning

This hands-on lab guides you through using the [Team Data Science Process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/overview) using [Azure Machine Learning Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/overview-what-is-azure-ml) with the Azure Machine Learning Workbench. 

- [ ] Understand and use the TDSP to clearly define business goals and success criteria
- [ ] Use a code-repository system with the Azure Machine Learning Workbench using the TDSP structure
- [ ] Create an example environment
- [ ] Use the TDSP and AMLS for data acquisition and understanding
- [ ] Use the TDSP and AMLS for creating an experiment with a model and evaluation of models
- [ ] Use the TDSP and AMLS for deployment
- [ ] Use the TDSP and AMLS for project close-out and customer acceptance
 

You'll focus on the objectives above, not Data Science, Machine Learning or a difficult scenario. 

## Introduction and setup 

You'll use Microsoft Azure and a Data Science Vitual Machine (DSVM) to run this lab, since it has everything you need to get started. (TODO)

You'll also use Visual Studio Team Services (TODO). And we'll also mention a few [Developer Operations (DevOps)](https://docsmsftpdfs.blob.core.windows.net/guides/azure/azure-ops-guide.pdf) integration steps as we go. 

## 1. Business Understanding

In the [Business Understanding](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/lifecycle-business-understanding) phase of the TDS, you discover the types of questions that the organization would like answered from data. 

In this workshop, you'll use the Iris flower data set, a canonical example for predictions and Data Mining. Your organization has requested a model that will classify the data they have collected from local gardens into one of three iris types.

## 2. Data Acquisition and Understanding

The [Data Aquisition and Understanding](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/team-data-science-process/lifecycle-data) phase of the TDSP (TODO)

In this workshop, we'll use a single file-based dataset. The Iris data set contains 150 records of 3 classes of iris flowers with numeric values for petal and sepal length and width.  This data set is traditionally used for classification and prediction â€“ to see which features of an iris can identify the flower as a certain type of iris. The values for length and width can be used to classify an iris into one of three iris types: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, or Iris virginica. Visually exploring this data also lets you see the grouping (clustering) of the records into these three different types of irises.
