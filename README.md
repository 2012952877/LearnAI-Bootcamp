# Cloud AI Bootcamp

The goal of this four day bootcamp is to provide a kick-start to individuals who need to develop deeper proficiency with the range of the Microsoft Cloud AI platform. These days are not "Getting Started with..." the various services and assume a 100-200-level familiarity with the products prior to getting started.

The structure of all 4-days is intended to be hands-on. Each lab should be able to be run in relative isolation, so as long as **appropriate pre-requisites are met**, an individual should be able to complete a given lab without needing to complete the others.

## Emerging AI Developers

Days one and two are oriented towards emerging AI Developers who are interested in leveraging AI-based technologies and services to build intelligent applications. These two days focus on hands-on activities that develop proficiency in AI-oriented services such as Azure Bot Services, Azure Search, and some of the Cognitive Services. For more details about the set of learning objectives, pre-requisites, and a tentative schedule, please see the appropriate [details file](emergingaidev_bootcamp).

## Professional AI Developers

Days three and four are oriented towards professional AI developers and Data Scientists who are interested in developing proficiency tools that will simplify the full data science lifecycle. These two days focus on hands-on activities that develop proficiency in AI-oriented workflows leveraging Azure Machine Learning Workbench and Services, the Team Data Science Process, Visual Studio Team Services, Azure Batch AI, and Azure Container Services.
